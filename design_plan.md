- Clean, minimal interface with ample whitespace

### 3. Client Dashboard
- Search bar at the top with real-time filtering

- Each card displays:
  - Client Name (prominent)
  - PAN (with partial masking for security)
  - GSTIN (with partial masking for security)
  - "View More" button with subtle hover effect

### 4. "View More" Modal
- Based on the provided image reference
- Modal overlay with semi-transparent background
- Three distinct sections as shown in the image:
  - Basic Data (top section, blue accent)

  - Income Tax Data (bottom right, light gray gradient)
- Each field has a copy icon (ðŸ“‹) that changes color on hover
- Close button in the top-right corner
- Subtle entrance/exit animations

## Responsive Design Considerations
- Desktop: Full layout with 3-column grid for client cards
- Tablet: 2-column grid, slightly larger touch targets
